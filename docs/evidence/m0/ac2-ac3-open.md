# M0-AC2 and M0-AC3 stay unchecked

Cited from `cursor/m0-ac23-honesty2-b19b` tip `7ae6d98` (PR #35). This branch does not replay that note. No acceptance box is checked.

(a) Still open. Silero is the ORT CPU execution provider (`device=cpu` on the #30 `taco run`, `ep=CPU` on the #32 residency series).

(b) Closed for prove reachable from `taco run`. #30 tip `e2ec751` printed `link_three=1 cancel_lifecycle=1 ac2=0 ac3=0` from an ad-hoc signed Mac `taco run` and exited 0. The signature is ad-hoc, not Developer ID. `ac2` and `ac3` stayed 0.

(c) Still blocks M0-AC2 and M0-AC3. #32 tip `a0e1614` is a Stop, not a fix. The 100-cycle `phys_footprint` delta is 252346632 bytes against a 33554432-byte tolerance. `whisper_free` retains the bytes. A Metal command-buffer flush missed the band (6-cycle delta 98812072) and was reverted. The earlier cite `0972b2d` recorded the same 100-cycle miss.

- [ ] **M0-AC2:** CPU VAD is open. Prove from `taco run` does not close this box.
- [ ] **M0-AC3:** The residency Stop at `a0e1614` is not a bounded teardown.
